        "content": "ATTENTION, ATTENTION to all those reporting problems with the quality of voice calls: unfortunately, the same problem happened to me, I received the phone from one of the main mobile operators in Poland. I became interested in the topic on the Internet, mainly on English-speaking forums, practically no one reported similar problems, and even here, on Ceneo, I could come across contradictory opinions. Therefore, I assumed that maybe the branded software was to blame. I decided to test this thesis empirically and started downloading clean software straight from Samsung. Effect? BINGO! call quality is terrible, so I invite you to read the Android forums on how to deal with debranding an Android phone (generally a piece of cake). kind regards! 5 stars because the phone itself is not to blame for anything. However, programmers and testers of our native operators do :)",

The fault was removed within an hour after ordering the parts, which is a huge plus for the authorized service center Unitra Eltron Serwis in Lublin, as they carry out repairs in this way (they do not keep the equipment in the service center unnecessarily). The phone itself is perfect, exactly what I expected. The only downside is the home button, which you have to press quite hard (the Note3 works much better). Quite a durable battery.",

Another advantage is the processor, although it is not as efficient as in its older sister, it is sufficient and does not cause the housing to heat up as much as in the regular S5. The battery life looks good, after turning it on I had 44 percent, then the update to 5.1.1 took place, I played with the settings and checked the functions, so I used it very intensively for 20 hours. I assume it will last two to three days for my needs.

        "content": "Opinion after a year of use. At first it was great, the battery lasted all day long. Then, due to frequent charging, the battery lasted a few hours. After purchasing a new original one, it was again without any problems. I don't know what this means. When I use it from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. I already have 15% and I try to turn off everything in the background and my screen is dimmed. Sometimes it can be brutally pruned, even more recently. I don't even turn on the battery saver mode because then it works. I wiped the phone down to 0 and it didn't make any difference. However, the camera is a big plus",
